# HackU6

HackU 6 for Dominion Enterprise
The task was to gather information on motorsport companies. Used webscrapping in python using google and yelp APIs to get information on companies. This data was cleaned in R. Then an interactive map is made, which lets the user see all the motorsport companies, their yelp review, google review, address, link to website etc. Clicking on one of the companies will show the 10 nearest competitors.

The app was [deployed](https://hassannaveed.shinyapps.io/webapp/) in R, but takes too much time to run due to the speed of the hosting servers.
